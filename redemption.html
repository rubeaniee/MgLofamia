                        On July 11, 2014, four years after taking his talents to South Beach, LeBron James ultimately decided he had unfinished business in Cleveland and returned to his original team via free agency.James’ announcement ended weeks of speculation about his future with teams across the league waiting on his move. “When I left Cleveland, I was on a mission,” James said in am essay written for Sports Illustrated. “I was seeking championships, and we won two. But Miami already knew that feeling. Our city hasn’t had that feeling in a long, long, long time. My goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what’s most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio.”

						Acquisition of Love
					</div>
					<div class="story-paragraph">
						As LeBron James returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers to join Kyrie Irving and bring the first championship of the franchise's history, the Cleveland Front Office decided to get more help and help they did get trading both of their first overall picks in Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett for big man Kevin Love. Now they were ready to compete..

						The Other Side
					</div>
					<div class="story-paragraph">
						Shifting perspective now, the rising team in the Western Conference, the Golden State Warriors led by Steph Curry were dangerous. They finished 67-15 in the 2014-2015 season in contrast to the Cavaliers' record which was 53-29. Could LeBron and the Cavaliers overcome this hurdle? We'll see as the two teams meet in the 2015 NBA Finals..

						Intentional Injuries
					</div>
					<div class="story-paragraph">
						In the first round of the 2015 playoffs, Kevin Love was injured by Kelly Olynyk in what seems to be a clear dirty play. Olynyk ultimately clamped down on Love's left arm while chasing a loose ball and Love's left shoulder was dislocated. Olynyk clearly had bad intentions on this play and this would go on to haunt the Cavs postseason.

						Hopelessness
					</div>
					<div class="story-paragraph">
						As if the Cavaliers couldn't get any unluckier, in Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals, Kyrie Irving fell down to the floor with 2 minutes left in overtime and injured his knee. First, the big man and now the floor general.. It seems as though everything that could go wrong went wrong. This will forever be seen as a day Cavalier fans would never want to remember, especially knowing that the Cavaliers had a legitimate chance of winning the championship that season.

						Greatest Team Ever
					</div>
					<div class="story-paragraph">
						After a disappointing end of the road in the 2015 NBA Finals, riddled by injury. The Cavaliers seek their revenge once again on the biggest stage. However, the Warriors were looking better than ever and finished with the best regular season record ever at 73-9 beating Michael Jordan's Bulls by one win. The question was in everyone's mind, did the Cavaliers even have a chance against the superteam of Golden State?

						Loss in Sight
					</div>
					<div class="story-paragraph">
						Once again, the Cleveland Cavaliers faced a huge problem. They were down 2-0. However, the Cavalier fans stayed positive and assumed it was only because of the homecourt advantage and that the Cavaliers would regain control back at home in Cleveland. The Game 3 win "confirmed" the suspicions of these fans. However, that Game 4 loss brought them back to being in low spirits.

						A First for Everything
					</div>
					<div class="story-paragraph">
						As the loss in Game 4 brought the series record to 3-1 in favor of the Warriors, almost everyone had lost hope in the Cavaliers and expected the Warriors to run away with the Championship. No team has ever came back from 3-1 in the NBA Finals. However, there's a first to everything.. And LeBron James is the exception of every rule.

						The Rejection

					<div class="story-paragraph">
						The Cavaliers tied the series at 3-3 after a splendid performance by the all-time great duo LeBron and Kyrie, with them having 41 points each. It was time for Game 7, the final game for all the marbles, and the rest is history. With the game tied at 89-89 and Iguodala about to score a layup, LeBron James, seemingly out of nowhere pulls off the greatest block in NBA History.

					<div class="story-paragraph">
						The Rejection was followed by the insanely clutch 3 point shot by Kyrie Irving over Stephen Curry completed the 3-1 comeback and ended the legendary season, ultimately bringing a championship to the Cavaliers. LeBron fulfilled his promise to the Cavalier fans and ended the 52- year title drought of Cleveland Sports, bringing them debatably the greatest championship in NBA History.
