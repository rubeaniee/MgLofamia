						LeBron James, widely considered as one of, if not, the best to ever
						touch a basketball has come a long way from being "just a kid from
						Akron". He battled poverty, never-seen-before pressure, and faced
						the most hostility from every athlete ever. Not to mention fighting
						two versions of the best team ever assembled. Nevertheless, he still
						prevailed despite the countless obstacles put in front of him.
					</p>

					<p>How did he do it?</p>
